To run compiler just pick the compiler for your OS e.g. for Linux 64bit do
    bin/compiler-linux-64bit examples/assignment.pas
    bin/compiler-linux-64bit examples/if.pas

To compile from source,
    Download and install Go.   https://golang.org/doc/install
    Set $GOPATH to workspace directory. See https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces and https://golang.org/doc/install#testing
    Move entire directory to $GOPATH/src
    Then do
        cd $GOPATH/src/compiler/
        go build
